I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had the correct `@tailwind` directives in my CSS file and the Tailwind plugin was properly installed and configured in my build process.  However, some classes worked fine while others were completely ignored.  I checked the browser's developer tools and confirmed that the stylesheet was loaded and that the selectors matched my HTML elements.  I also tried restarting the build process to see if that was the issue, but that didn't help.
